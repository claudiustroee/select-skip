## Documentation Select Skips Page

## Skip Card
    -Changed the style of the card to make it look more user firendly
    -I was thinking "4 yard skip" is not intuuitive enough to understand how bit it is. 
    -So I added a list of valueable information for example how many bin bags/tones of soil can go in a skip.
    -I also changed the images with some AI generated ones.
    -Added new Label for "Allows Heavy Waste"
    -Added transport cost
    -Changed style for "Private Property Only"

## Slider
    -I have added all the cards into a carousel/slider
    -For desktop I showed 3 slides, for tablet 2 and for mobile just a list one on top one the other
    -On the bottom div after selected I have changed the style.

The page right now is better as in responsiveness.
The information is showed more clearly.
I feel line the overall user experience is better.
